# shaRRRe
Paper has played a crucial role in human history and will continue to do so in coming years but is it worth using it putting environment on stake? The GenWiz’s shaRRRe app comes with a solution. It aims to turn every day paper driven activities into more environment friendly user experiences. It works on 3R’s principle: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. In Reducing, we emphasize on using e-Books instead of physical ones and also share documents by scanning. In cases where using physical books is necessary, our Reuse option allows the exchange of old, unused stack of books to reach someone who truly needs them. But then there are cases when books can no longer be reused and thus we give the option of recycling at home or giving it to local scrap dealers and NGOs working in this direction.  In whole, the shaRRRe aims to make world a better place with less trees cut down for the sole purpose of making paper.
